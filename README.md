# Surfs_Up Hawaii Analysis

<b>Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.</b>

The client is interested in opening a surf and shake shop to serve the locals and tourists of Hawaii.  In order to gain backing from an investor, the client must provide data to determine whether the surf and shake shop will bring in revenue.  By considering weather data for more than one season, we can determine the probability of year-round business survival based on how often the weather is nice enough to attract customers to the beach area. 

<b>Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables.</b>

•	Based on the data, the month of June has a mean temperature of 74.94 degrees.  This is typically considered positive beach weather.

•	The month of December returns milder weather than June, but still typical beach weather.  The mean temperature for December is 71.04 degrees.

<b>Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.</b>
  
Based on the results of the analysis, both June and December provide warm weather ideal for opening a surf and shake shop on the beach. Considering the average temperatures, it is apparent that the shop can survive year-round in this area.

Two additional queries I would consider would include a more in-depth look into how often the temperatures are warm, especially in the winter months.  The greatest question is whether the number of days with warm weather outweigh the amount of cold days.  Another query to look into would be the number of tourists visiting the area on average during each month.  This could bring higher revenue during busy seasons that would then counterbalance the loss of revenue during slow months.
